        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Roast like grandma used to make and easy gravy. This is a recipe my grandmother has made for years. I love the gravy that goes with this! Serve with mashed potatoes and your favorite vegetables!</p>
       
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 (3 pound) beef sirloin tip roast</li>
                <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 cups brewed coffee</li>
                <li>1 and a half cups water</li>
                <li>2 cubes beef bouillon</li>
                <li>6 basil leaves</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 cup water</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
            </ul>


        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat olive oil in stock pot over medium heat; sear roast in the hot oil until slightly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove roast from pot and place on a plate. Cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot oil until onion is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Return seared roast to the stock pot; pour coffee and 1 1/2 cup water over roast. Add beef bouillon, basil leaves, 1 tablespoon salt, and pepper.</li>
                <li>Bring broth to a boil; reduce heat to medium low, cover stock pot, and simmer until meat is falling apart, 2 to 3 hours. Remove and discard basil leaves. Transfer roast to a serving dish and cover with a lid or aluminum foil, keeping the broth in the stock pot over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Whisk flour and 1/2 cup water together in a bowl until smooth. Slowly whisk flour mixture into broth until gravy is smooth and somewhat clear; season with salt. Pour about half the gravy over the roast and pour the rest into a gravy boat for serving.</li>
            </ol>
